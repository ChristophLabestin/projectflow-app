#Privacy Policy
##Introduction
Welcome to the privacy policy for **ProjectFlow** (the “Service”). This policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal data when you use our Service. We are committed to complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, known as **DSGVO** in Germany) and other applicable privacy laws. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.
##Data Controller and Contact Information
The Service is operated by **ProjectFlow UG**, which is the “data controller” responsible for your personal data. **ProjectFlow UG** is located at **Frührlingsstraße 8, 84082 Laberweinting, Germany**. If you have any questions or requests regarding your personal data, you can contact us at **hello@getprojectflow.com**. 

**Controller vs Processor**: In most cases, we act as the data controller for information you provide directly to the Service (e.g. your account details). However, for personal data that you upload or manage within the platform on behalf of others (for example, contact lists for email campaigns or personal information about your team members in a workspace), you or your organization may be the data controller, and we function as a data **processor** handling that data on your instructions. In those cases, you are responsible for ensuring you have a legal basis to process that personal data and for providing any necessary notices to the individuals concerned.

##Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Data We Collect
We collect various types of personal data when you use ProjectFlow. This includes information you provide to us directly, information generated through your use of the Service, and information from integrated third-party services. Below is an overview of the categories of data we handle:
- **Account Information**: When you register an account, we collect your email address and may ask for a display name and profile photo. This basic profile data is stored in our systems GitHub. If you sign up via an OAuth provider (like Google or GitHub), we receive your name and email from that provider instead of a manual signup
GitHub. Your user ID is also recorded for identification in the system. This information is necessary to create and maintain your user account.
- **Authentication Data**: We use Firebase Authentication to manage user logins. If you register with an email/password, your password is stored in hashed form by Firebase (we never see your raw password). We also store authentication factors and credentials as needed for security: for example, if you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) with an authenticator app (TOTP), the fact that 2FA is enabled (and necessary secret data to verify codes) is stored securely by Firebase. If you use passwordless login methods like **passkeys** (WebAuthn), we store your passkey credential information (public key, credential ID, and device details) associated with your account GitHub. This allows you to authenticate with biometrics or security keys. We also retain information on your authentication providers (e.g. whether you linked a Google or GitHub account for login) GitHub. All such data is collected to **secure your account** and enable your preferred login methods.
- **Profile and Workspace Data**: You have the option to provide additional profile details in your account. This may include a display name (if not provided already), and **optional** information like your job title, bio/biography, address, skills, or profile picture. If you choose to fill out these fields in your profile, we will collect and store that information GitHub. You can adjust your privacy settings for some profile fields within the app (for example, who in your workspace can see your email or other details). We also keep track of your **workspace membership** and roles. If you belong to a workspace (team account), we store your role (e.g. Owner, Admin, Member, Guest) and group memberships within that workspace GitHub. The Service records the projects and groups you have access to, and who invited you or when you joined a workspace. This **workspace data** is used to manage permissions and collaboration features.
- **Project and Content Data**: ProjectFlow is a productivity and project management platform, so by its nature we process the content you and your team input into the Service. This includes project details and metadata, tasks and issues you create or are assigned to, milestones, mind map entries, comments you post, files or media you upload, and any other content or data you submit while using the platform. We store this data in our database and file storage in order to provide the Service’s core functionality (organizing your projects and workflows)
GitHub
. For example, if you create a task or leave a comment, we will store that content along with information on who created it and when. Likewise, if you upload files (such as images or documents to the media library or as attachments), those files are stored in our cloud storage and associated with your account or project. Please note: The content you and your users input may incidentally include personal data (for instance, a task description could include someone’s name or contact info if you add it). We do not normally require you to input special categories of personal data into the platform, and you should avoid uploading any sensitive personal information unless necessary. Any personal data contained in your project content will be processed by us solely to provide the Service to you (we do not use it for our own purposes).
**Social and Marketing Features Data**: If you use the integrated Social Studio or Marketing suite features, we collect the data you input for those purposes. For example, if you create a social media campaign or scheduled post, we will store the campaign details (campaign name, goals, audience, schedule, etc.) and the content of the social posts (captions, images, hashtags, etc.) that you prepare
GitHub
GitHub
. The platform may also store analytic or status information about these campaigns (e.g. whether a post is approved, scheduled, published, or metrics like number of clicks if you input them). Similarly, if you use the marketing campaign planner, we store details like campaign objectives, channels (e.g. Google Ads, Email, etc.), and any related data you enter about strategy or budget. All such information is provided by you to use these features and is considered your business data – we just process it to enable the campaign planning and tracking functionality.
**Contact Lists and Email Marketing Data**: As part of the marketing tools, you can manage email campaigns and recipient lists. If you import or add recipient contact data (for example, a list of email subscribers or customers to send email campaigns to), we will store those contacts’ information in our system on your behalf
GitHub
. This typically includes an email address and may include name, and any other details you choose to upload for each contact (such as tags, group assignments, or custom fields like company, gender, etc. that you configure)
GitHub
. We also record the status of each contact (subscribed, unsubscribed, bounced) and basic email delivery statistics for your campaigns (e.g. how many emails were sent, opened, clicked, etc.)
GitHub
. Important: If you provide us with personal data of other individuals (e.g. uploading your customer email list), you are responsible for ensuring you have collected that data lawfully (for instance, that you have their consent to send marketing emails). We will only use these contacts’ data to operate the email functionality as directed by you (for example, to send the emails you compose to the recipients you list, and to track unsubscribes or bounces).
**Integration Data (Third-Party Accounts)**: ProjectFlow offers integrations with certain third-party services (such as GitHub and Facebook/Instagram) to streamline your workflow. If you choose to connect a third-party account, we will collect and store the minimal data necessary for that integration. For example, if you link a GitHub account to sync issues, we will ask for a GitHub personal access token or use OAuth to get permission. We will store your GitHub token securely in your profile or project settings
GitHub
 so that the application can access your repositories or create issues on your behalf
GitHub
. Similarly, if you connect a Facebook or Instagram account for the Social Studio, we will store the access token and the associated account ID/username for the social account
GitHub
. This allows us to fetch your social media profiles and to publish content you schedule from within ProjectFlow. We fetch data like repository names or social profile names as needed to display in the app
GitHub
. We do not use these tokens or integration data for any purpose other than providing the integration functionality that you have enabled. You can disconnect integrations at any time via the settings, which revokes our access.
**AI Features and Usage Data**: ProjectFlow includes AI-assisted features (e.g. the AI Studio for brainstorming, content generation with Google’s Gemini model, AI-powered search answers, and an image editing tool using Google Vertex AI Imagen). If you use these features, we may process some of your data through third-party AI services. For instance, when you request the AI to generate ideas or analyze text, the prompt or content you provide is sent to Google’s generative AI API (Gemini) in order to get a result
GitHub
. Likewise, if you use the image generation or editing feature, the images and prompts you provide will be sent to Google’s Vertex AI Imagen service for processing
GitHub
. We do not receive personal data from these AI providers about you; we only get the generated result to display to you. Internally, we log your AI feature usage (such as how many AI text tokens were processed, or how many images you generated)
GitHub
. This AI usage data includes counts of tokens and images and timestamps, and is used to enforce usage limits or quotas and to help us understand feature usage. We do not profile users based on this data; it’s more about ensuring fair use and capacity planning. The content of your AI prompts or outputs is not used by us for any purpose other than to deliver you the result in real time, and it’s not shown to other users (unless you choose to save AI-generated content into a project for your team to see).
**Preferences and Cookies**: We remember certain user preferences to improve your experience. For example, you can set your preferred language, date format, time zone, theme (light/dark mode), and we track whether you have completed tutorials or onboarding flows. These preferences may be stored in your user profile and/or in your browser’s local storage on your device
GitHub
 (so that we can apply your settings without repeatedly asking). The Service itself does not use tracking “cookies” for analytics or advertising purposes. However, for technical reasons, our authentication system and hosting may use essential cookies or similar technologies. For instance, Firebase Authentication might use a cookie or local storage to keep you logged in securely, and when you access the web app, your browser automatically sends your session token or cookie to authenticate you. These are strictly necessary for the Service to function and are not used to track you across other sites. Aside from these necessary mechanisms and the local storage for preferences, we do not place any third-party tracking or advertising cookies on your device. (We also currently do not use any Google Analytics or similar analytics services in the codebase
GitHub
, so your usage is not being tracked by third-party analytics scripts.)
**Technical Logs and Device Information**: Like most online services, we automatically collect some technical information about your use of the Service. When you interact with our backend (e.g. calling our API or cloud functions), our servers (Firebase Cloud Functions and Hosting) will log certain information. This includes the IP address of the device you used, timestamps of requests, and possibly your device/user agent information (which can include browser type and version, OS, device model, etc.). For example, when you perform actions such as signing in or making a request to our API, Firebase logs may record your IP and request details for security and debugging. We also may capture your platform or browser information when registering passkeys (to label your passkey with the device type)
GitHub
. We do not actively use IP or device data to profile you, but we might use it for fraud detection or security (e.g. recognizing a suspicious login). Technical logs are generally used only for monitoring and troubleshooting the Service and ensuring the security of your account.
In summary, the personal data we collect serves to identify you, provide you the Service’s functionality, facilitate collaboration with others, and secure your account. In general, we do not collect sensitive categories of personal data such as government IDs, financial information, or health data through ProjectFlow, and we ask that you refrain from storing such data in the platform. If you believe we have inadvertently collected sensitive data, please contact us so we can address it.
**How We Use Your Data**
We use the collected personal data for the following purposes, all in accordance with GDPR principles of necessity and lawfulness:
**Providing and Maintaining the Service**: First and foremost, we use your information to operate ProjectFlow and deliver its features to you. This includes using account and authentication data to log you in and verify your identity, using your workspace and project content data to display and synchronize the information you and your team input, and generally ensuring the app functions as intended for project management and collaboration. For example, we use your email to allow you to log in and to send you essential account communications (like verification emails or password resets), and we use the content you enter (tasks, projects, etc.) to populate your dashboard and enable you to work with your team. Without processing your data in these ways, we wouldn’t be able to provide the Service.
**Workspace Collaboration and User Communications**: If you are part of a team workspace, the data you input (like your profile name, comments, or tasks) may be shown to other authorized users in your workspace to enable collaboration. We manage permissions so that only those with proper access (e.g. members of your project or workspace) can see the relevant information. We also use your data to send you notifications within the app or via email (if you have email notifications enabled) about updates in your projects – for example, if you are assigned a task or if someone mentions you in a comment, we might alert you. These communications are part of the Service’s functionality. We also use your preferences (like language and time zone) to localize content and dates for you and to remember UI settings (e.g. keeping your chosen theme).
**AI-Assisted Features**: When you engage an AI feature (text generation, AI-powered search, image editing, etc.), we use your input data to generate the requested output. For instance, if you ask the AI to brainstorm project ideas, we will send your prompt (which may include project context you provide) to our AI partner (Google) and retrieve the generated ideas
GitHub
, then display them to you. We do not use these prompts for any other purpose, and any temporary copies are only to facilitate the AI processing. If you choose to save AI-generated content into your project, it becomes part of your ProjectFlow content like any other user-entered data. We also track the amount of AI resources you use (token counts) to enforce any usage limits and ensure system performance
GitHub
. This usage tracking is primarily for internal monitoring and fair-use enforcement, not for profiling users.
**Social Media and Integration Actions**: If you connect third-party integrations (such as posting to social media or syncing with GitHub), we use your data to perform the actions you request. For example, when you schedule a social media post via our Service, we use the content you composed and the stored access token to publish that post on the integrated platform (e.g. we send the caption and image to Facebook/Instagram’s API for publishing at the scheduled time)
GitHub
. When you ask us to sync issues with GitHub, we will use your saved token to fetch or update issues in your GitHub repository
GitHub
. In short, we use the integration data solely to carry out the specific integration operations you have initiated, such as creating GitHub issues, retrieving commit info, fetching social profile data, or uploading scheduled posts. We do not post anything to your connected accounts or access your third-party data unless you specifically use an integration feature that requires it.
**Email Campaigns and Newsletters**: If you utilize the email marketing tools within ProjectFlow, we will use the contact information and email content you provide to send out the emails as directed. For example, when you initiate an email campaign to a list of recipients, our system will take the email template/content you created and the recipient list (email addresses and any personalization fields) and send the emails via our email service provider on your behalf. We track sends, opens, clicks, and bounces to provide you with campaign statistics
GitHub
. Separately, if you subscribe to our own newsletter or waitlist (through our public website), we will use your email address to send you the requested newsletter updates or to follow up on the waitlist (only after you have confirmed via double opt-in)
GitHub
. You can unsubscribe at any time, and we will then stop sending you the newsletter (your email may remain on file marked as unsubscribed to honor your opt-out).
**Service Improvement and Analytics**: Internally, we may use aggregated or de-identified information about how users use ProjectFlow to improve the Service. This can include metrics like the number of projects created, which features are used most often, or general performance information. We may look at logs or usage data to debug issues (for example, checking an error log if a function fails, which might include a user ID or action that caused it)
GitHub
. We do not have third-party analytics trackers collecting your browsing behavior, but we do perform our own analyses on the data in our database to improve features (for instance, using project data to develop a project health scoring feature within the app, or using feedback to refine AI models). Where possible, we use aggregated data for these purposes. Any insights gained are used to enhance functionality, user experience, and security.
**Security and Fraud Prevention**: We process personal data as needed to secure our platform and users’ accounts. This includes using authentication data and IP/device information to detect and prevent suspicious logins or account misuse. For example, we might use your IP address to determine if a login attempt is coming from an unusual location and prompt for additional verification. We keep logs of important actions (like login attempts, password changes, integration linkages) to monitor for fraudulent or malicious activity
GitHub
GitHub
. If we detect behavior that violates our terms or could harm the Service or other users, we may use personal data (like account identifiers and content involved) to investigate and take action (such as notifying you or, if necessary, disabling an account to protect others). This processing is in our legitimate interest to keep the Service safe and reliable.
**Legal Compliance and Enforcement**: In certain cases, we may need to process personal data to comply with legal obligations or to defend our legal rights. For example, we may retain certain information about financial transactions (if any billing info is involved) for accounting and tax reasons, or we may process data in response to lawful requests by public authorities (such as complying with a court order to disclose content). Additionally, we might use or preserve data when necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or to handle legal disputes (for instance, logging when a user gave consent to terms, or using logs to demonstrate how an account was used if needed for a legal claim).
We will only use your personal data for the purposes described above or for purposes that are compatible with those (for example, using account data to provide support if you reach out with a problem). We do not use your data for any kind of automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you – there are no automated credit checks, scoring, or profiling happening beyond the scope of providing the app’s features (the “project health score” and similar analytics within the app are generated from project data to help you manage projects, not to evaluate you as an individual).
**Legal Bases for Processing (EU GDPR)**
Under the GDPR, we must have a valid “legal basis” to process your personal data. We rely on the following legal grounds, depending on the context:
**Performance of a Contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)**: Most of our data processing is justified by the fact that it is necessary to provide you with the Service you requested – essentially, to fulfill our contract with you. When you sign up for ProjectFlow and agree to our Terms, a contract is formed for us to deliver the platform’s functionality. We need to process your account data, project content, communications, etc., as described above, in order to perform that contract. For example, using your email to create an account and log you in, or storing the tasks you enter so that you can retrieve them later, are necessary for the Service to work as intended.
**Your Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)**: We rely on consent in certain situations. For instance, if you join our newsletter via the website or sign up for a waitlist, we will only send marketing emails to you if you have given consent (and confirmed it via the double opt-in email)
GitHub
. You can withdraw that consent at any time by unsubscribing. Within the app, if in the future we introduce any feature that uses your data in a way that is not obvious or necessary for the service (for example, publishing a testimonial with your name or using your data for a new purpose), we would ask for your consent. Also, if we ever integrate optional analytics or cookies that require consent, we will obtain it. Note that when you connect third-party accounts or import data about others (like contacts for email campaigns), you are effectively instructing us to process that data – we consider that analogous to consent/contract by you, since it’s part of the service you want us to provide. If you need to collect consent from the individuals on your contact lists, that is your responsibility as the controller for that data.
**Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)**: We process some data under the basis of legitimate interests, after carefully considering the impact on your privacy. Our legitimate interests include: maintaining the security of our platform (e.g. processing IP addresses and login data to prevent fraud), improving and developing our services (e.g. analyzing how features are used in aggregate to decide on new improvements), and communicating with you about product updates or similar (unless those communications require consent under applicable law). When we rely on legitimate interest, we ensure that our interest is not overridden by your data protection rights – for example, security processing is necessary to protect all users, and does not unduly infringe on privacy, as it actually helps safeguard personal data. If you disagree with any processing based on legitimate interests, you have the right to object (see Your Rights below), and we will evaluate such requests.
**Legal Obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)**: In some cases, we may need to process data to comply with a law. This is not the main basis for most day-to-day processing on ProjectFlow, but it could apply to things like retaining transaction records for tax law, or disclosing data when a valid legal request is received. We will only do so when required by law.
We will clearly indicate if we ever need your personal data for a purpose that requires your consent or is outside the scope of the original purpose for which it was collected. Generally, by using ProjectFlow, you acknowledge that your personal data will be processed as needed to provide you the service (this is the contract basis). For optional uses, we will ensure there is a choice.
**Cookies and Tracking Technologies**
ProjectFlow’s web application uses minimal cookies/trackers, mostly for essential functionality:
**Essential Cookies/Storage**: We use authentication tokens (which may be stored in a cookie or local storage by Firebase Auth) to keep you logged in across sessions. These are strictly necessary for secure login and session management. For instance, Firebase may use a cookie to remember that you have already signed in so you don’t have to re-authenticate on every page load. We also utilize your browser’s local storage to store certain preferences and the state of your current workspace (tenant) selection
GitHub
. For example, we save your active workspace ID so that if you refresh the page, the app knows which workspace’s data to load for you. Another example is storing UI preferences like theme (dark or light mode) so that we render the interface accordingly without delay. These local storage entries and essential cookies are not used to track you on other sites and do not contain sensitive personal data (typically they contain IDs or flags relevant only to our app).
**No Third-Party Marketing Cookies**: We do not use any third-party advertising or analytics cookies on our app or site at this time. That means we are not dropping Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar tracking cookies that follow you outside of our domain. All of your interactions with ProjectFlow stay within our platform and any data analytics are done in-house or through our service providers as described, not through profiling cookies.
**Optional Cookies**: If in the future we introduce any cookies that are not strictly necessary (for example, to enable additional analytics or to remember preferences beyond what is needed for service), we will update this policy and, if required by law, prompt you for consent before using them.
You have the ability to control cookies through your browser settings. However, keep in mind that blocking cookies or local storage for ProjectFlow may disrupt certain functionalities – for instance, you might not be able to stay logged in or your preferences might not be saved. Since we currently only use essential cookies/storage, disabling them could effectively log you out or prevent use of the service. For our public marketing website (e.g. the homepage or blog on getprojectflow.com), we similarly aim to keep cookies to a minimum. Any newsletter signup or waitlist forms on the site might use a cookie to facilitate the double opt-in process or remember that you’ve subscribed, but again, we do not engage in third-party tracking ads. If you ever have questions about a specific cookie or piece of storage used by ProjectFlow, feel free to contact us. We want to be transparent and ensure you’re comfortable with how we handle these technologies.
**Third-Party Service Providers (Data Recipients)**
In order to provide the Service’s functionality, we rely on several third-party services who process data on our behalf (often called “processors” or "sub-processors"). We also at times share data with third parties at your direction (such as when you use an integration). We do not sell your personal data to anyone. We only share it with: (a) service providers under strict data processing agreements, or (b) other parties when you explicitly tell us to (or as required by law). Here we outline the key third parties involved and what data might be shared with them:
**Google Firebase (Google Cloud Platform)**: Our application is built on Google’s cloud infrastructure. We use Firebase for authentication, database, file storage, cloud functions, and hosting. Firebase Authentication stores your credentials and manages login (as mentioned earlier, this includes handling password hashing, OAuth login tokens, and multi-factor authentication). Firestore Database is our primary data store where all your project data, profile info, and other content are stored – our Firebase project is configured to use European servers (multi-region EU) for Firestore
GitHub
, so your data is stored in the EU by default. Firebase Storage is used for file uploads (e.g. images, documents) – those files are stored in Google Cloud Storage. By using Firebase, certain data necessarily flows through Google’s systems. For example, when you log in, Firebase will see your email and password (or OAuth token) to authenticate you; when data is stored in the database, it resides on Google’s servers (encrypted at rest). We have chosen Google Cloud’s europe-west/eu regions for data storage to help comply with EU data locality preferences
GitHub
. Google acts as a data processor for us, meaning they are bound to only process data under our instructions. We have a Data Processing Agreement with Google that includes the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard any transfers of personal data outside the EU. In practice, routine operations (database queries, file storage) stay within EU data centers, but Google as a company is US-based, so there is a possibility that some management or support access could involve non-EU regions. We trust Google Firebase to maintain high security standards; however, we want you to be aware that your data is hosted on Google’s cloud.
**Google Gemini and Vertex AI (Generative AI Services)**: Apart from core infrastructure, we use Google’s AI services to power the AI features in ProjectFlow. When you use AI text generation or analysis (Gemini), our servers send the prompt and necessary context to the Google GenAI API and receive the results
GitHub
. Likewise, when you use the image editing/generation feature, our function sends the image (in base64 form) and prompt to Google’s Vertex AI Imagen endpoint to generate new images
GitHub
. These requests are made from our server side with our credentials, and the data (prompts, images) goes to Google’s AI models temporarily for processing. Google may process this data (and they have their own terms about not using it to train their models without consent – as of this writing Google says data submitted to their GenAI APIs is not used to improve the AI model). We do not retain the content of your AI interactions beyond delivering the result to you, except possibly in transient logs or if you save the result. Google’s handling of the data is governed by our contract with them and their privacy commitments as a processor. Nevertheless, this is a case of your data leaving our immediate environment to a third-party service in order to function. We ensure all such communications with Google’s APIs are encrypted in transit. Google’s AI services are also hosted on Google Cloud; we use the European region for Vertex AI requests when possible
GitHub
GitHub
 (our image function is set to run in europe-west3, and calls the API in that region). However, it’s possible that the AI model processing might not be entirely EU-local. By using these features, you acknowledge that the content you provide in an AI prompt will be shared with Google for the purpose of generating the result.
**Email Service (SMTP)**: We use an email delivery service to send out system emails (such as verification emails, password resets, notifications, and the optional newsletter/waitlist emails). Currently, we have configured an SMTP server for sending emails
GitHub
. By default, our configuration may use an email service provided by Google (for example, sending through Gmail’s SMTP or another mail provider). Regardless of the provider, if we send an email to you, obviously your email address is processed by that provider, and the content of the email as well. For newsletter and waitlist confirmations, we handle those via Firebase Cloud Functions that send through our SMTP setup
GitHub
. We ensure the SMTP credentials are stored securely (environment variables) and that the email service is reputable. In the future, we might use a dedicated email delivery platform (like SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar); if so, this policy will be updated. The email service provider acts as a data processor, using your data only to send emails on our behalf.
**GitHub API**: If you choose to integrate GitHub, we interact with GitHub’s REST API. This means that certain data will flow to/from GitHub: for example, we might send a new issue you created in ProjectFlow to GitHub (including the issue title and description)
GitHub
, or fetch a list of your repositories and issues from GitHub to display in the app
GitHub
. To do this, we store your GitHub personal access token or OAuth token, which is used as an authorization header in API calls to GitHub
GitHub
. GitHub (a service by Microsoft, based in the US) will receive those API calls along with data like your token and any content we send (issue titles, etc.). We limit calls to only what’s needed (e.g. list repos, create/update issues, post comments
GitHub
). GitHub is essentially a recipient of data when you intentionally sync or create issues. They will handle that data under their own privacy policy (as it becomes part of your GitHub account data, e.g., a new issue in your repo). We do not share your ProjectFlow data with GitHub unless you initiate it via the integration, and your GitHub token is not shared with any party except being sent to GitHub’s servers for authentication as intended.
**Facebook & Instagram (Meta) Integration**: If you connect a Facebook Page or Instagram account for publishing social media content, we integrate with the Facebook Graph API provided by Meta Platforms. We will obtain an access token from you through Facebook’s OAuth flow (which forwards it to our app) and store that token
GitHub
. Using that token, we may make API requests such as retrieving your connected Facebook Pages/Instagram Business accounts
GitHub
, pulling basic profile information (like account name and avatar) to show in our UI, and publishing content that you have approved/scheduled. For example, when you click “Publish” on a scheduled Instagram post in ProjectFlow, our system will call the Graph API endpoint to upload the photo and caption to Instagram on your behalf
GitHub
GitHub
. Those requests include the content of the post and are of course received by Facebook’s servers. Meta will then store and display that content on their platform per normal usage of their service. We do not send any ProjectFlow data to Meta except what’s needed for the specific action (we’re not bulk-transferring your entire project data or personal info – only the social post content or integration queries). Meta (Facebook/Instagram) might process some usage info (like logging that our app with your user ID made a request) for their own security and analytics. We treat Meta as both a processor (when they are delivering content on our instruction) and as an independent controller for any data once it’s on their side (since a published post becomes subject to Facebook/Instagram’s terms). You can revoke the Facebook/Instagram integration at any time, which invalidates the token so we can no longer access your account. Also note, when you link an account, Facebook may show you what permissions you are granting (like posting content, reading insights, etc.); we only use those permissions to implement the features you use, not for any other purpose.
**Other Integrations**: ProjectFlow may offer other integrations or use other APIs, such as Google for sign-in (Google OAuth for login), or potentially other social networks or tools. If we use Google Sign-In, that means we receive from Google your basic profile info (name, email) and Google knows you’re using our app for authentication. For completeness: our Google Sign-In and GitHub Sign-In are handled by Firebase Auth, which means Google and GitHub are aware when you use them to log in, as part of the OAuth process. We also support login via Passkeys which uses the WebAuthn standard; that process is primarily local between your device and our server (with attestation handled by the WebAuthn API), not involving third-party services except possibly your device’s platform (e.g. Apple or Microsoft may have some involvement in storing credentials on your device, but that doesn’t send data to them about our service specifically). If we introduce any additional third-party integrations (like Google Drive, Trello, etc.), we will update this section with what data is shared. In all cases, our philosophy is that third-party integrations are opt-in and driven by your needs – we only transfer data to those services as necessary to fulfill the integration function you activated.
**Payment Processor**: (This is only relevant if ProjectFlow charges for subscriptions or purchases). At present, ProjectFlow is in a pre-release or free beta stage (as implied by references to "Pre-Beta" in the code). If in the future we start charging for the Service, we would integrate a payment processor (like Stripe) to handle billing. That would involve sharing minimal personal data such as your email and maybe name with the payment provider, and of course any payment information you provide would go directly to them. We would update our policy at that time to reflect the specific processor and scope of data. For now, you can assume no payment data is collected by us.
We ensure that each third-party service we use is bound by appropriate data protection terms. We have Data Processing Agreements in place where needed (for example, with Google for Firebase and AI services, and we adhere to Facebook’s platform terms for protecting data). Whenever personal data is transferred out of the European Economic Area (EEA) – for example, to the United States, which is where some of these companies are based – we rely on mechanisms such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legally valid transfer frameworks to ensure your data has equivalent protection as in the EU. We also evaluate the data importers’ security measures and policies (for instance, Google and Microsoft have robust privacy and security compliance programs). Aside from service providers, the only other parties who might receive your personal data are:
**Team Members and Other Users**: As part of normal Service operation, certain data is shared with other users in your workspace or projects. For example, your display name and avatar are visible to other members of your projects; if you post a comment or complete a task, other members of that project see that activity along with your name. This is not “third-party” sharing in the legal sense (since they are also users you have chosen to collaborate with), but it is worth noting that any data you intentionally share in-app (like posting in a public workspace or sending an invite email to someone) is disseminated per your actions.
**Legal or Regulatory Disclosures**: If we are compelled by a valid legal request (such as a subpoena, court order, or binding request from law enforcement) to disclose certain data, we may do so. We will only share the data that is necessary to comply with the request and only after verifying its legitimacy. Whenever possible and legally permissible, we would inform you of such requests.
**Corporate Transactions**: If our company is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We would ensure the new owner continues to respect your personal data in line with this privacy policy (or you would be given notice and a chance to opt out if the policies change materially).
We will never sell your personal information to advertisers or unrelated third parties. We do not share data with advertisers, data brokers, or social media companies for their independent use. Any integrations with social media are under your control and solely to facilitate content you want to push to those platforms, not to send your usage data to them for analytics or advertising. In summary, third parties involved in providing ProjectFlow are limited to infrastructure providers (like Google), integration endpoints (GitHub, Meta, etc., when you use them), and standard business/legal channels. All are used with your privacy in mind and under agreements that restrict their use of your data.
**Data Storage and International Transfers**
We are based in [Your Country], but ProjectFlow’s user base may be global. We want to be transparent about where your data is stored and processed:
**Primary Storage Location – European Union**: We have configured our cloud infrastructure to store data in the European Union. Specifically, our database is in a multi-region EU data center (Google “eur3” region)
GitHub
 and our server functions run in europe-west3 (in Germany)
GitHub
. This means that if you are an EU user, your data is initially stored within the EU which is aligned with GDPR preferences. Even if you are not in the EU, we use the EU region to store everyone’s data for consistency and because EU data protection standards are high.
**Backup and Redundancy**: The nature of cloud services means there are backups and replicas of data for reliability. Firestore (our database) keeps multiple replicas within the multi-region (e.g. data might be mirrored in multiple EU locations for fault tolerance). We also may periodically export backups of the database for disaster recovery. Those backups would also be stored on secure cloud storage (again likely in EU region unless otherwise configured). We treat backups with the same security as live data. No physical media of backups leave the cloud environment.
**Transfers Outside of EU**: Despite storing data in the EU, some of our service providers are international companies (Google, Meta, Microsoft). It’s possible that some personal data might be accessed or transferred outside of the EU, for example:
Google, as a US-headquartered company, might need to provide support or might route certain requests (especially AI-related or authentication flows) through servers outside the EU.
When you use integrations like GitHub or Facebook, you are interacting with systems in the US (GitHub’s API and Facebook’s API servers are mainly in the US). That means, for example, an issue title or social post content you send will travel from our EU servers to those US-based services
GitHub
GitHub
.
Our email sending may use SMTP servers that are in the US (for instance, if using a US-based email service or even Google’s Gmail servers which are global).
We take steps to ensure lawful transfer for these cases. Our contracts with Google and other providers include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), committing them to uphold GDPR-level protections even when data leaves the EU. For integrations like Facebook and GitHub, when you authorize the integration, you are effectively consenting to that transfer as necessary to use the feature (since the data must go to those services). We ensure any such transfer is encrypted in transit (HTTPS secure requests) and only the minimum data required is transmitted.
**No Global Access for Unneeded Reasons**: We do not routinely access or transfer user data to any offices or personnel outside of the EU unless needed. For example, if [Your Company] is based in the EU, our team will access data from within the EU when performing support. If [Your Company] has developers or support staff in other countries, they would only access data if necessary and under strict controls. We aim to localize data access as much as possible.
**Hosting and Network**: The ProjectFlow web application is delivered through Firebase Hosting (which uses a global CDN). When you access our service, your static assets (like JavaScript, images of the interface) might be served from a server near you (which could be outside the EU) for speed, but those assets do not contain your personal data – they’re just the application code. API calls you make will be routed to our EU servers (with DNS possibly pointing you to the nearest edge location then tunneling to EU region). This ensures minimal latency while keeping data storage centralized.
In summary, your data is primarily stored in the EU, but some processing and access might involve other regions, particularly the United States, due to the providers we use. We have taken measures (contracts, technical safeguards) to protect your data in those scenarios. By using ProjectFlow, you understand that your personal data may be transferred or accessed by our subcontractors in countries outside your own. We will always ensure such transfers comply with applicable laws and that your data remains protected to the standards of the GDPR. If you have questions about where specific data is stored or processed, or need more detail on cross-border safeguards, please contact us. We can provide more information or a copy of the relevant contractual terms upon request.
**Data Retention**
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Below we outline our retention practices for different categories of data:
**Account Data**: If you have an account with ProjectFlow, we will keep your account information (like your email, name, and credentials) as long as your account is active. This is required to let you log in and use the Service. If you decide to delete your account or if your account is inactive for an extended period, we will initiate deletion of your personal data, subject to the considerations below. Account deletion will remove personal identifiers and authentication info from our primary systems (though some content you created might remain if it’s tied to a shared workspace, see below). We may retain your email in a suppression list if you opted out of emails, simply to ensure we respect your opt-out.
**Project and Content Data**: All the projects, tasks, and other content you generate in ProjectFlow are stored until you or an authorized user deletes them. We do not impose a fixed expiration on user content – it’s your data, and we keep it available to you until you choose to remove it. You (or your workspace admin) can delete specific items (e.g. delete a task or file) or entire projects/workspaces. When you delete data through the app, it is typically removed from the live database immediately or after a short safety interval. However, remnants of the data might persist in our backups or logs for a while. We generally overwrite backups periodically; any logs containing data will be cleared out in accordance with our log retention (usually within a few weeks to a few months). Important: If you are part of a shared workspace, data you contributed (like tasks or comments) may be considered part of that workspace’s records. If you leave the workspace or delete your account, normally the content you created remains accessible to the remaining workspace members (at least, whatever is necessary for project history), but it may be anonymized (for example, your name might no longer be displayed, but the comment still exists as “Deleted User”). Workspace admins can contact us to request deletion of content if needed, but they might have their own reasons (legal/compliance) to retain project records. We will work with our customers to honor retention requirements.
**Integration Tokens**: If you link third-party accounts, the tokens are stored as long as you keep the integration active. If you disconnect an integration or it expires, we remove or invalidate the stored token. We may keep a record that an integration was connected (for audit/security), but not the token itself after disconnection. For example, your GitHub token is stored in your profile or project document
GitHub
; if you remove it, it’s gone from our database. The same applies for social media tokens.
**Logs and Metadata**: Our system logs (which may contain IP addresses, device info, and action records) are retained for a limited period for debugging and security. Typically, we keep detailed logs for a short time (several weeks) and high-level logs a bit longer. For instance, Firebase automatically rotates logs; we might also export some logs for security audits and retain those for a few months. After that, log data is deleted or anonymized. We don’t keep logs indefinitely unless they’re part of a specific security investigation.
**AI Usage Data**: Information about your AI feature usage (token counts, image generation counts) is aggregated monthly. We may reset usage counters every month
GitHub
GitHub
 to implement monthly limits. We might keep historical aggregate usage (e.g. total tokens used per month) for analytics, but this typically wouldn’t be stored longer than necessary for analyzing trends. It may be retained in a non-personally identifiable way.
**Newsletter/Waitlist**: If you provided your email for our newsletter or waitlist on the public site, we retain that email until you unsubscribe or ask us to delete it. If someone doesn’t confirm the opt-in (for newsletter/waitlist), we only hold the unconfirmed request for a short time (our system sets a 4-hour expiration for confirming newsletter signups
GitHub
, and if not confirmed, that pending record expires and can be purged). Confirmed subscribers we hold indefinitely until removed. We include an unsubscribe link in every newsletter email, and if you click it or request to unsubscribe, we will mark your address as unsubscribed (and cease mailings). We may keep the email on a suppression list to avoid re-sending anything, unless you request complete removal.
**Closed Accounts**: If you delete your ProjectFlow account, we endeavor to remove or anonymize personal data associated with your account. However, there may be legal requirements to keep certain data. For example, if you ever made a purchase (in the future if payments are introduced), we might need to retain transaction records for X years for tax reasons. Or if we had a security incident, we might preserve some log evidence. In general, upon account deletion, we purge user-provided content and profile data from production, and only minimal info is retained if absolutely required (e.g. an archived record of an email consent, or data in backups that will eventually cycle out).
**Backups**: Data in backups may persist until those backups are rotated out. Our backup retention schedule might be, say, 30 or 60 days (we will define this internally). That means even after you delete something, it could remain in encrypted backups for that period. We will not restore or use that data except for disaster recovery. After the retention time, backups containing the deleted data will be overwritten or deleted. We do not have infinite backups, so eventually deleted data falls off all systems.
Once the retention period is over or the data is no longer needed, we will either delete it in a secure manner or anonymize it (so it can no longer be linked to an individual). We also continuously review the data we have; if we find we have data that is unnecessary, we aim to delete or anonymize it even if you haven’t specifically requested it. If you need a specific piece of personal data deleted sooner (for example, you accidentally uploaded something and want it fully expunged), please contact us. We will make good faith efforts to accommodate requests for early deletion, provided we are not required to keep that data. Keep in mind that communication data you send us (like support emails) might be retained separately in our email records. We treat those similarly – we keep them as long as needed to resolve your query and for a short while after (to build a history of support interactions), then delete if appropriate. Finally, note that residual copies might exist in system caches or distributed storage temporarily, but those will be overwritten shortly after active deletion. Our goal is that when something is deleted, it’s gone from all user-accessible areas immediately, and gone from all backups/logs within a reasonable period.
**Data Security**
We take the security of your personal data seriously and have implemented various measures to protect it:
**Encryption**: All network communication with ProjectFlow is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS. Whether you are accessing the web app or our APIs, your data is transmitted securely to prevent eavesdropping. Additionally, our database and storage utilize encryption at rest (Google Firebase automatically encrypts data on disk on their servers). Any sensitive fields (like passwords) are further protected by hashing or encryption at the application level – for instance, passwords are hashed by Firebase Auth, and we never store them in plaintext. For particularly sensitive data like integration tokens or SMTP credentials, we rely on Firebase’s security rules and/or encryption to keep those safe (and in a real production environment we’d consider extra encryption; our code comments note that SMTP passwords should ideally be encrypted
GitHub
).
**Access Control**: Data in ProjectFlow is protected by authentication checks. You can only access your workspace’s data if you are a logged-in member of that workspace. We enforce role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer roles with specific permissions) to ensure users only see and do what they’re permitted
GitHub
. On the backend, our Firestore security rules and Cloud Function checks ensure that users cannot read or write data that they shouldn’t (these rules restrict data by user ID, workspace ID, and role privileges). Within our team, access to production data is limited to authorized personnel who need it for maintenance or support (and even then, they would access it under strict confidentiality).
**Authentication Security**: We offer and encourage strong authentication options like OAuth (so you don’t have to set a weak password) and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via authenticator apps or Passkeys. These features add layers of security to your account. We store passkey public keys and credentials as described, which cannot be used to impersonate you without your physical device. We also monitor login attempts and can lock accounts after excessive failures to mitigate brute force attacks. If you enable 2FA, even if someone somehow got your password, they still couldn’t log in without the second factor.
**Network and Infrastructure Security**: Our servers run on Google Cloud, which has robust security at the physical and network level. We use Cloud Functions with least privilege (each function only has access to what it needs). We keep our software dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities. The database is not exposed directly to the internet except via our secure API endpoints with proper rules. We also employ security rules for Firestore that only allow valid authenticated requests to specific collections. We regularly review these rules for any gaps.
**Testing and Monitoring**: We test our application (including security rules) to catch any misconfigurations. We also log important events and monitor for anomalies. If suspicious activity is detected (like an unusual spike in usage or a known attack pattern in logs), we investigate promptly. Firebase provides tools like Security Center and alerts that we utilize. We also use role-based API keys and secrets for third-party services to ensure that if any key is compromised, its scope is limited. For example, our API calls to Google AI require our service account credentials which are securely stored, and our database access requires proper credentials that are not exposed on the client side.
**Employee and Contractor Access**: Within [Your Company], access to personal data is strictly limited. Team members who need to support the service may access data, but only what is necessary. We train our team on data privacy and security practices. All access to production systems is logged and requires authentication. We also ensure that any contractors or processors we work with are under NDAs and follow our security standards.
**Preventive Measures**: We implement measures against common web threats: e.g., we guard against SQL/NoSQL injection by using Firestore’s parameterized queries and validation; we protect against XSS by properly encoding user inputs in the UI; we mitigate CSRF by not using cookies for sensitive operations (and when we do, ensuring they are same-site or using tokens for verification). We also utilize Firebase’s built-in protections (like App Check, etc., if configured) to ensure only our app can access the backend.
**Data Isolation**: Each customer’s data is logically separated by unique identifiers (tenant/workspace IDs). This means users from one workspace cannot access another workspace’s data unless they have been added. Our multi-tenancy model is designed to prevent data leakage across accounts
GitHub
.
**Backups and Recovery**: We regularly backup data to prevent loss, as mentioned, and those backups are secured. In case of any data incident (like corruption or accidental deletion), we have the ability to restore from backup to minimize impact. Access to backup locations is also restricted.
While we strive to protect your data, it’s important to note that no system can be 100% secure. There is always some risk of a breach or vulnerability. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal data, we will follow applicable laws to notify affected users and authorities within the required time frames, and we will take necessary steps to mitigate the damage. You also play a role in security – we encourage you to use a strong password and keep your account credentials confidential. Enable 2FA or passkeys for added security. Be cautious of phishing attempts; we will never ask for your password via email. If you suspect any unauthorized access to your account, please change your password immediately and contact us.
**Your Rights (GDPR and Equivalent)**
As an individual in the European Union (or in jurisdictions with similar data protection laws), you have certain rights regarding your personal data. We are committed to honoring these rights. Below is a summary of your key rights:
**Right to Access**: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and to obtain information about how we process it
GitHub
. This is commonly known as a “data subject access request.” Upon verification of your identity, we will provide you with an overview of your data – typically, this includes data like your profile info, account details, and perhaps logs of your activities or communications. (Much of this data is accessible to you directly in the app, but you can ask for a structured report).
**Right to Rectification**: If any of your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to have it corrected or updated. For example, if you realize we have the wrong spelling of your name or an outdated email, you can change it in your profile or ask us to fix it. We encourage you to keep your account information up-to-date. In many cases, you can directly edit your info (like changing your display name or profile details in settings). For any fields you cannot edit, contact us and we will assist in updating them.
**Right to Erasure**: Commonly known as the “right to be forgotten,” this right allows you to request deletion of your personal data. You can delete certain data yourself (for instance, remove content you’ve posted, or delete your entire account via the app’s account settings if that feature is available, or by contacting support). If you request erasure, we will delete your personal data from our systems, provided we don’t have a legal obligation or overriding legitimate interest to keep it. Note that if you’re part of a workspace, deleting your account might not auto-delete all content you created in shared projects (as those could be important to other users’ project history). In such cases, we can anonymize or pseudonymize your identity on remaining content (e.g., show “Former User” instead of your name). We’ll explain any such caveats if they apply. If you want all content you added removed, we may need to coordinate with the workspace owner. In any event, we will do our best to honor the spirit of your request and remove personal identifiers.
**Right to Restrict Processing**: You can ask us to limit or “pause” the processing of your data in certain circumstances. For example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or have objected to processing (see below) and we’re evaluating your request, you can request that we restrict processing during that period. Another example is if you need data preserved for a legal claim while we’d otherwise delete it – we can mark it as restricted so it’s not actively processed, just stored. When processing is restricted, we will not use the data except for storage and will inform you before lifting the restriction.
**Right to Data Portability**: You have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another controller (for example, to another service), where technically feasible. This typically applies to data we process by automated means based on your consent or a contract. In practice, this could mean if you request it, we could export your project data or profile info in a CSV or JSON format for you to take elsewhere. We will do our best to accommodate such requests in a reasonable format. (Note: This right is more geared towards things like social media posts or photos on a platform; in our case, your project data can be quite complex. We’ll work with you to determine an appropriate way to hand over your data if needed).
**Right to Object**: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data when that processing is based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on public interest. If you object, we must stop processing your data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights or the processing is for legal claims. For example, you can object to processing of your data for direct marketing (though we currently don’t do any marketing without consent). You could also object if we were doing an analytics profiling on legitimate interest grounds – in response, we would either stop that processing or demonstrate why we believe our grounds override your privacy (in most cases, if a user objects, we will err on the side of stopping the processing). If you object to any processing of your data, please contact us specifying what you object to and why. We will respond promptly with a decision or request for clarification.
**Right to Withdraw Consent**: If we are processing any of your data based on consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, if you consented to receive the newsletter, you can unsubscribe (withdrawing consent for that use of your email). Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing that was done before withdrawal. Also note that if you withdraw consent for something necessary to provide the service (say, hypothetically you had consented to let us use some data and then withdraw, but that data is needed for your account), we might have to terminate that aspect of service. We will inform you if that’s the case so you can make an informed decision.
**Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-Making**: You have rights related to not being subject to decisions based solely on automated processing that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you. As noted, ProjectFlow does not perform such automated decision-making (no AI is deciding something like whether you get to use the service or not without human involvement). So this right is more of a formality here – you won’t be subject to it, and thus there’s nothing to opt-out of. However, if you ever feel that an automated feature is affecting you significantly, let us know and we will review it.
To exercise any of these rights, you can reach out to us at **[Contact Email]**. We may need to verify your identity to prevent unauthorized requests (for example, we wouldn’t want someone else to falsely claim they’re you and get access to your data). We strive to respond to requests within one month, as required by GDPR, and will inform you if we need more time (up to a two-month extension in complex cases). There is generally no fee for exercising your rights. However, if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (like repetitive requests without justification), we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act, as permitted by law. But we will communicate with you and try to find a reasonable solution. If you are not satisfied with our response or believe we are processing your data unlawfully, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Supervisory Authority. In Germany, for example, you could contact the data protection authority of the German state in which you reside or the Bavarian Data Protection Authority (BayLDA) if [Your Company] is based in Bavaria. In the EU generally, you can contact the authority in your country of residence or the authority where our company is established (if different). We would, of course, appreciate the chance to address your concerns directly first, so we encourage you to contact us with any complaints and we will do our best to resolve them. Your privacy rights are very important to us. We will not retaliate against you for exercising any of these rights, and we are here to help facilitate your control over your personal data.
**Children’s Privacy**
ProjectFlow is not intended for use by children under the age of 16 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in this age group. If you are under 16, you are not permitted to create an account or use the Service, unless we receive verifiable parental consent through means that comply with applicable law (for example, GDPR and related national laws require parental consent for processing personal data of children under 16 in many cases). Our platform and content are generally geared towards businesses and professionals, not minors. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 16 without proper consent, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible. For example, if a minor manages to sign up by misrepresenting their age, once discovered, we will deactivate the account and remove personal data. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 16 has provided personal information to us, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.
**Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make material changes to how we handle your personal data, we will provide a prominent notice – for example, by posting a notice on our website or within the app, or by emailing you (for significant changes, especially if you’ve provided us your email and allowed such contact). The “last updated” date at the bottom of this policy will always indicate when the latest changes were made. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. If changes require your consent (e.g. if in the future we want to use your data for a new purpose that originally required consent), we will obtain that consent from you. Otherwise, continued use of ProjectFlow after the updated Privacy Policy becomes effective will be deemed acceptance of the changes.
**Contact Us**
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please do not hesitate to contact us: **[Your Company Name]**
Data Protection Officer/Privacy Team (if applicable)
Address: **[Company Address, City, Country]**
